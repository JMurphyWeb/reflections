lesson 2

	git init
	initialises a new repo - does not commit

	git status
	prints current status of git repo


	git add 
	adds a file to the 'staging area' which sits between the 'working directory' and the repository. The staging area gives us more control over what we commit to the repository at one time


	git diff
	Compare working directory with staging area
	
	git diff --stage
	Compare staging area with repository files

	git reset --hard
	***CAREFUL***
	deletes all changes in working directory and staging area. 

branches

	git log --graph --oneline
	shows a graph of the branches and commits

	git show commit_id
	shows the difference between a commit and it's parent. 
	Useful as git log will give commits in chronological order, even if they belong to different branches.

	git checkout -b new_branch_name
	creates a new branch and performs checkout onto that branch
	Useful if we are creating a new feature, or we decide to keep some changes to a previous commit that would be lost if we checkout master.


	git checkout master
	git merge master branch_name_2
	merges changes from branchname2 to master

	git branch -d coins
	deletes branch called coins. All commits are accessible through the commit chain so no need for the branch coins

	Updating my branch so it has latest code from master, but stays as a seperate branch:
	git checkout branch_name
	git merge master branch_name
