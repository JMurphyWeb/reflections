	diff
	In Terminal, find the differences between two files by using diff. Parameter -u makes the response more readable:
	$ diff -u original_file_name new_file_name

	
	git log
	git log --stat 
	(includes statistics about the files that have changed)
	press q to stop viewing git log output

	git log -n 1
	shows just 1 log
	
	git diff 1st_git_id 2nd_git_id
	git diff no_arguments will compare the files in the working directory and the staging area
	
	git checkout git_repo_id
	will 'detatch head' and allow us to inspect a previous commit.
